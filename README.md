* **[Product Vision]()**

    **What are we doing?**

    We are developing a multiplatform mobile app that allows users to easily give feedback about a conference or event by using their smartphone. The feedback will be given to the speaker, allowing him to get real time statistics about the atendees' opinion, attendance and rating of the event. Furthermore, atendees will be able to leave questions for the speaker to answer later. 


    **Why are we doing it?**

    We are developing this project in the context of ESOF.


    **What's it gonna bring of good to the world?**

    We intend to give atendees an easy and practical way of giving their opinion and asking questions about an event. This allows them to have a meaningful impact on the event.
    For the speakers, we want to allow them to receive reviews about their presentation(s) which can be helpful to improve. Besides that, the speakers will also be able to easily get statistics about attendance rates, and reply to questions that the atendees leave for him about the conference.


*   **[Elevator Pitch]()**


    FeedTheConference is an innovative way of getting feedback from participants in conferences, be it directed towards other attendees, speakers or the organization itself.
Unlike other forms of getting feedback, this app allows the organization to get the feedback in real time and automates its processing, making it easy to analyze.
